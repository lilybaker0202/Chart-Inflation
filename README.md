# Inflation Tools - Your Economic Data Powerhouse! 🔥🎉

Yo yo! Welcome to my **Inflation Tools**! 🎵 This is a dope project crafted by me (a super skilled high school senior coder) using Python + Flask + Chart.js to dive deep into inflation trends, crypto prices, and economic indicators! 💪 Packed with interactive charts, real-time data, and a slick interface, it’s a must-have for any data geek! ✨

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Chart Inflation** 📊: Track currency value changes, cumulative inflation, exchange rate history, and more—data from 1990 to 2021, all in one place!
- **Crypto Mode** 💰: Monitor hot cryptos like ADA and BTC with pinpoint accuracy!
- **Economic Index** 🌍: Check out GDP growth rates, unemployment, S&P 500 index, and other economic vibes—super comprehensive!
- **Style Goals** 🎨: Responsive design that slays on mobile and desktop, with button groups stretched to 1200px for that premium look!

## 🎮 Getting Started
Wanna rock Inflation Tools? Follow these steps and you’ll be good to go in 5 minutes! 😎

### 1. Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lilybaker0202/Chart-Inflation.git
cd Chart-Inflation
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment
- Create a virtual environment (keeps things clean!):
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  ```
- Activate it:
  - Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
  - Mac/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install the dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 3. Run the App
- Fire it up with:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- Open your browser and hit `http://0.0.0.0:8080/` to explore the magic! 🌟

## 🛠️ Project Structure
Here’s what’s inside the repo:
- `app.py`: The main Flask app logic.
- `templates/`: HTML files for the charts (e.g., `chart_inflation.html`).
- `static/`: CSS and JS files (e.g., `css/style.css`, `js/app.js`).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages you need.
- `.gitignore`: Keeps junk like `.venv` and `flask_session/` out of GitHub.

## 📊 How It Works
- **Chart Inflation**: Input start/end years, currencies, and amounts to see inflation trends visualized with Chart.js.
- **Crypto Mode**: Switch between crypto tickers (e.g., ADA, BTC) to track price history.
- **Economic Index**: Toggle between GDP, unemployment, and more for a full economic snapshot.

## 🤝 Contributing
Got ideas or spot a bug? Jump in! 🙌
- Fork the repo.
- Create a branch (`git checkout -b feature-cool-stuff`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add cool stuff"`).
- Push and open a PR (`git push origin feature-cool-stuff`).
Let’s make this project even lit together! 🔥

## ⚠️ Notes
- This project uses `Flask-Session` with filesystem storage—session files are ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Data is hardcoded or from `crypto_data.csv` for now—feel free to expand it!
- Tested on Python 3.9+; adjust if needed.

## 🙌 Shoutouts
